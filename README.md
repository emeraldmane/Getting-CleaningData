# Cleaning-Data

## Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment Project

The run_analysis.R script can be ran against the dataset available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Download and extract the archive to a folder named Getting&CleaningData. 

Executing the run_analysis.R on that dataset will output the results to a text file named tidy.txt.

A codebook named CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data is available in the repository.
